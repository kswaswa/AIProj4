Run the program with "python2.7 Clustering.py numClusters dataFile".

The graph of all the points clustered by color should pop up.

If the num of clusters > 8, the program won't work since I only have 8 colors. Copy and paste my array of colors so it repeats again if you would like more than 8 clusters.
